        <h1>linux is  a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,[16] an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.[17][18][19] Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. </h1>

            <p>Linus Torvalds, a student at Finland's University of Helsinki, stepped into the gap. Using the GPL and programming tools from the GNU Project by richard stallman, in 1991 he announced an Internet-centred effort to develop a PC UNIX of his own—Linux. Linux was the first major Internet-centred open-source project.</p>

        Popular Linux distributions[20][21][22] include Debian, Fedora Linux, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland and a desktop environment such as GNOME, KDE Plasma or Xfce. Distributions intended for servers may not have a graphical user interface at all or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses and recommends the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance of GNU software in many distributions, causing some controversy.[23][24] Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.[

    <p>Arch Linux (/ɑːrtʃ/)[7][8] is an independently developed x86-64 general-purpose Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is intentionally minimal so that users can add only the packages they require.[9]

        pacman, a package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, is used to install, remove and update software packages.[10]
        
        Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, meaning it has no major releases. An Arch Linux installation is kept up-to-date by regularly updating the individual pieces of software that it comprises. The only "releases" are snapshots of main system components released monthly to provide an up-to-date installation medium.[11] </p>

        <divc class="debian">
            <p>Debian (/ˈdɛbiən/),[5][6] also known as Debian GNU/Linux, is a free and open source[a] Linux distribution, developed by the Debian Project, which was established by Ian Murdock in August 1993. Debian is the basis for many other distributions, such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Tails, Proxmox, Kali Linux, Pardus, TrueNAS SCALE, and Astra Linux.

                Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel and, as of September 2023, the second oldest Linux distribution still in active development, only behind Slackware. The project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader and three foundational documents: the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. New distributions are updated continually, and the next candidate is released after a time-based freeze.
